## Nationality Predictor App

This is a small simple app that I created to practice React. I styled the App by using Styled Components.
The idea of the app is simple - you input your first name or the first name of the person you would like to search, and the app will return the probability that the person in question is from a specific country.

Big thanks to https://nationalize.io/ for allowing me to use their API!
